    <string name="white_description">White noise has equal power at all frequencies. Human hearing
        is however logarithmically spaced, where a doubling of frequency (an octave) is perceived
        the same regardless of the frequency. This makes white noise seem quite harsh and high pitched.
    </string>
    <string name="pink_description">Pink noise has a logarithmically even distribution of power.
        Since each octave contains the same amount of power it is received as a naturally smooth
        noise by the human ear.
    </string>
    <string name="red_description">Red noise, also known as Brown noise (due to the particle physics
        applications in Brownian motion), has a power density that decreases with
        increasing frequency. It is perceived to be the most pleasant and is often used
        while studying or as a baby sleep sound.
